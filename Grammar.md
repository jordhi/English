## 1A - Have (auxiliary or main verb)

### As a *main verb*  
We don't usually contract **have** when it is a main verb  

1. >**Possession** (is stative/non-action)  
    >- Is not used in a continuous sentences  
    >- Used to talk about illnesses and relationships  

2.  >**Actions and experiences**: 'have + object'  
    >- *__Have a bath, a drink, a chat, etc.__*

3. >**Obligation** imposed by others, rules and regulations  

4. >To say that you ask or pay another person **to do something for you**  
    >- Have + object + past participle: **_I have my eyes tested_**  

### As an *auxiliary verb*  

We make questions by inverting have and the subject, and negatives with haven't/hasn't or his contracted 've / 's/  'd  

1. >**Possession** *Have got* (not had got). (informal English)  

2. >In **negative** sentences leave out 'got': *I haven't time*  

3. >**Obligation** Is used for a specific obligation:  
    > - I've got to make a quick phone call (specific)  
    > - I have to wear a suit for work (general without got)  

4. >In order to form the **present perfect simple ans continuous**  
    > - I have seen two cows  
    > - I have been seeing with your brother  

5. >**Other forms**: future perfect, perfect infinitive, past perfect, etc.
